# Phil's Players

A set of open source video players with simple GUIs for video engineers.

I got bored of bad player demo websites which didn't cater to the simple way I like to interact with software.

My intention is to slowly populate this page with players, using a simple, idiot proof GUI.

A (short) list: DashJS (Pure), VideoJS w/Contrib HLS, Shaka Player...
